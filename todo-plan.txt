compare 99875337 and mh1641 especially timing and new/old mode
-all timing for reset named the same except mh has "datah", all other timing exact same for reset
-seems to be new mode only maybe?

general notes: theres some stuff for capacitance and all that but should be simple to just pick larger values than needed
huh doesnt seem to be like minimum speed, lets keep things slow for better probing
mh datasheet is simpler, go off of that

Led pin: PB1
mh1641 pins: find

test serial communication
test entering new mode, detecting card swipe - looking for asic pulling line low
test writing raw bits to serial - after above look at datasheet
test writing bits to serial in meaningful/useful form

optional: test storing stuff in flash

writer: wire in h bridge
test writing literally anything
test head written with no speed control
implement speed switches
